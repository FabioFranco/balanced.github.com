## We're Now Processing Over $0.5 Billion a Year!
Last quarter we announced how we're taking on PayPal and Stripe while experiencing incredible growth:
- We were processing over $1M per day 
- Transaction volume grew by 757% in 2013
- Customer base grew by 784% in 2013
- We were working with over 450 customers

We're seeing continued momentum. **We grew by 28% over the last month (Feb to Mar)**, putting us at over half a billion dollars ($500M+) in annualized volume.
